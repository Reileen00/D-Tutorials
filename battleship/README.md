1. Each player must secretly place their ships on a grid of ten columns by ten rows.

2. Each player will also be in possession of a second grid of the same size. Where the first grid is their own ships, the second one is a mirror of their opponent’s battlefield.

3. Players pick a square at random, calling it by its row and column number. This represents their firing a missile directly at that square.

4. The player who successfully locates all their opponent’s ships first by hitting each square they occupy is the winner.
